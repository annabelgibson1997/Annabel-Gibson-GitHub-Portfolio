# Using ONE for loop, write code to output the star pattern in the task.


beginning = 1 #creating a starting integer so that user input is not necessary to run this code

#if beginning == 1:  
#        star = "*"
#        for i in range(0 ,4): # for some reason if I move this number up to 5 an extra row of five stars appear at the end of the pattern?
#                print(star)
#                star = star + "*" # this takes care of stars going up to five
#                if star == "*****":
#                        for i in range (0 , 5): # is this for loop allowed because it is nested?
#                                index = 5-i
#                                print(star[0:index]) # Index gets SMALLER all the way to 0, ending the sequence
